# Reproducible analysis of T cell VRd treatment TEA-seq data

This repository houses Jupyter Notebooks that are used for reproducible analysis of T cells treated 
with bortezomib, lenalidomide, or dexamethasone and profiled using the trimodal single-cell assay TEA-seq.

These notebooks can be used within the Human Immune System Explorer (HISE) framework for traceable, 
reproducible analysis that results in a Certificate of Reproducibility.
